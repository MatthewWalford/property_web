# property_web
This is code to extract the sold properties from Domain.com.au.

Notes
-Can only extract one suburb at a time
-Uses a randomly generated user agent for each connection made
-Currently the iterations are set to 5 for testing. 
-Domain.com.au only allows for the first 50 pages to be searched with 20 properties on each. 

Bugs
-Bedroom, bathroom, and carspace information for some properties is not extracted correctly. Currently working on this
